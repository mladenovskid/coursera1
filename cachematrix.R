## The below functions make it easy to cache a matrix
## 

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
